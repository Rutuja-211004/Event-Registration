Overview  
The Event Registration Portal* is a web application built using *Flask* that allows users to:  
âœ” Browse upcoming events*  
âœ” Register for events* by submitting their details  
âœ” View registered participants* for each event  

The application uses *CSV* for storing event data and *Excel* for tracking registrations, making it simple yet functional for small to medium-sized events.
